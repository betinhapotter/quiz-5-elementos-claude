# SUMMARY
# =============================================================================
summary:
  total_investment: "10 hours"
  
  first_year_returns:
    code_quality: "150 lines removed"
    development_speed: "50% faster new screens"
    maintenance: "86% fewer files to touch"
    risk_reduction: "12h/year bug prevention"
    
  recommendation: "PROCEED"
  confidence: "high"
  
  justification: |
    With 5+ planned screens and ongoing maintenance needs,
    the design system investment pays for itself within
    the first 2 new screen builds. Additional value comes
    from reduced design drift and easier onboarding.
